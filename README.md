# CRX8

In this repository I used the [Chest-Xray8 dataset](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC) to experiment with different architectures, train classifiers and try to visualize gradients of trained models.


This repository is somewhat unordered, however, I wrote a little [website](http://www.favianhatje.com) showcasing integrated gradients of a trained model.
